# C21-Book-Search-Engine

## Project Description

This is a book search engine that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. Users can search for books, create an account, save books to their account, and manage their saved books.

## Features

- Search for books using the Google Books API
- User authentication (signup and login)
- Save books to a personal list
- View saved books
- Remove books from the saved list

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. On the homepage, you can search for books without logging in.
2. To save books, click on the Login/Signup menu option to create an account or log in.
3. Once logged in, you can save books from your search results.
4. View your saved books by clicking on the "See Your Books" option in the menu.
5. Remove books from your saved list using the "Delete this Book!" button on each book.
6. Log out using the "Logout" button in the menu.
